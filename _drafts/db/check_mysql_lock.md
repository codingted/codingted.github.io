SELECT * FROM INNODB_LOCK_WAITS;
A list of blocking transactions

SELECT * 
FROM INNODB_LOCKS 
WHERE LOCK_TRX_ID IN (SELECT BLOCKING_TRX_ID FROM INNODB_LOCK_WAITS);
OR

SELECT INNODB_LOCKS.* 
FROM INNODB_LOCKS
JOIN INNODB_LOCK_WAITS
  ON (INNODB_LOCKS.LOCK_TRX_ID = INNODB_LOCK_WAITS.BLOCKING_TRX_ID);
  A List of locks on perticular table: 

  SELECT * FROM INNODB_LOCKS 
  WHERE LOCK_TABLE = db_name.table_name;
  A list of transactions waiting for locks: 

  SELECT TRX_ID, TRX_REQUESTED_LOCK_ID, TRX_MYSQL_THREAD_ID, TRX_QUERY
  FROM INNODB_TRX
